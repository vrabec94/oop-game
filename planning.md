GAME PLANNING
_________________________________________________

Milestone 1: user can move the player left/right

- Initial setup (hmtl, css, js)
- create git repo
- create player class
     size
     appearance ?
     position
     move left, move right
     startPosition / stop


- decide if player moves left/right
- avoid user from going outside

Milestone 2: obstacles appearing in the UI + obstacles move + we detect if there is a collision
    (note: for this milestone it's okay if obstacles appear always att th esame position) MVP

Milestone 3: make the game more interesting & fix bugs
    - random position for obstacles
    - prevent player from going outside
    - gameover + restart/start button
